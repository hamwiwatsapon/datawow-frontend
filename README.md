   ```

     ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

- **Sign in:** Enter a username to log in. User data is stored in cookies for authentication.

- **Create/Edit/Delete posts:** Available for authenticated users. Only the post owner can edit or delete their posts.
- **Comment:** Add comments to posts if logged in. The comment textarea auto-expands as you type.
- **Protected routes:** `/our-blog` requires login; unauthenticated users are redirected to `/signin` with an alert.
- **Delete confirmation:** Deleting a post prompts a confirmation dialog.
- **Loading indicator:** A loading bar appears at the top of the page during async actions (e.g., login, post, comment).
